# AI geoprocessing scripts
A collection of python (v3.7) scripts used to process SAR images.
* `map_envi.py` provides simple ENVI format loading and saving procedures.
* `map_adfilter.py` provides a procedure to fix "broken" pixels as well as an example of fix_pixels + anisotropic_diffusion filtering of a composite SAR image.
* `map_assemble_tensor.py` loads a number of ENVI images, performs some filtering and/or cropping and assembles a numpy tensor (ndarray) from them, according to instructions read from `recipe.json` file that should reside in `data` directory along with ENVI images.
* `map_process.py` performs further data filtering, clusterization with k-means, folowwed by fitting of gaussian mixture model on the given tensor (instructions for additional filtering are drown from same `recipe.json`). The trained model is than used to assign label probabilities to each image pixel.
* `map_vis.py` is a template for a data (clusterization result) post-processing, visualisation and saving procedure.

The scripts could be used on any kind and number of SAR imaging channels but were tested on a composition of multiple Sigma (geo-referenced intensity) and coherence (between two acquisitions) channels. The scripts assume channels to be in linear scale at the input and than perform conversion to logarithmic scale along with filtration at `map_assemble_tensor.py`.
